About VTK and garbage collector
-------------------------------

Some VTK object manager X11 resource and must always be released between a 
vtkRenderer.Lock and vtkRenderer.Unlock call. If not segfault (or other
strange things may happen).

List of object which must be carrefully collected (to be completed):
- vtkPolyDataMapper

To detect which object are collected at a given time you may change the
vtkObjectBase class:

	private StackTraceElement[] creationStack;
	private final static boolean LOG_FINALIZE=Boolean.getBoolean("vtk.log.finalize");
	private final static boolean DIS_FINALIZE=Boolean.getBoolean("vtk.disable.finalize");
	public vtkObjectBase()
	{
		if(LOG_FINALIZE)
			creationStack = Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace();
	}

	@Override
	protected void finalize() {
		if (!vtkDeleted)
		{
			if(LOG_FINALIZE)
			{
				Exception e = new Exception();
				e.setStackTrace(creationStack);
				e.printStackTrace(System.err);
			}
			if(!DIS_FINALIZE)
				Delete();
		}
	}

Java writting is buffered so Delete must be disabled else a segfault
may occure before the stack has been displayed.
