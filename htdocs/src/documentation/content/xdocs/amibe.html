<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Amibe is the name of jCAE main mesher. It reads OpenCASCADE geometries (BRep, STEP and IGES)
and produces 3D finite element surface meshes.  It is designed to create very large meshes
(hundreds of millions of triangles), and tries to mesh even if geometry is dirty.</p>
<h2>Algorithm</h2>
<p><img src="amibe-diag.png" alt="Amibe diagram overview"/></p>
<p>All edges are discretized first.  This step is fast and does not need to be
parallelized.  Faces are then discretized, and edge discretization is not modified
to ensure that final mesh is conformant.  This is the most costful step, so it
has been designed to run on clusters if needed.  Each face can be meshed without
interaction from other faces; there is no restriction on final mesh size, but in
this step, each mesh of a face has to reside in memory.  when finished, each mesh is
written into separate files, and merged to produce final 3D mesh.  Of course this step
does not require loading whole mesh into memory!</p>
<h2>Patch mesher</h2>
<p>In OpenCASCADE faces are 2D parametrized surfaces.  We mesh those parametrized surfaces
so that the 3D projection on our geometry has the desired properties (edge length and/or
deflection), as described in
<a href="ftp://ftp.inria.fr/INRIA/publication/publi-pdf/RR/RR-2928.pdf">Maillage de
surfaces param&eacute;triques</a> (in French), by Houman Borouchaki and Paul Louis George.</p>
<h1>Amibe file format</h1>
	<h2>Background</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Mesh files must be easy to parse with any language on any architecture.</li>
		<li>Mesh may be huge (hundred millions of triangles) and handled by
		out-of-core algorithms.</li>
		<li>A mesh is a set of nodes and triangles, but other data may be added
		(groups, results...), so the file format must be extendable.</li>
		<li>There is no existing open file format designed to work with out-of-core
		algorithms, in both Java and native.</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Format overview</h2>
	<p>XML is a convenient solution to store structured data, it is portable and
	our own file format can be easily designed and extended.  But its main
	drawback is its verbosity and parsing an XML file containing several gigabytes
	would be challenging.  We chose an intermediate solution: an XML file
	contains only structured data (link to geometry file, list of geometrical
	elements, etc) and raw data (like node coordinates) are stored into separate
	binary files.
	<h2>1D, 2D and 3D meshes</h2>
	<p>Amibe creates 3 meshes in the same directory:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>A discretization of geometrical edges. These are 1D linear elements
		(beams).</li>
		<li>A 2D discretization geometry. These are 2D triangles.  In order to help
		parallel computations, tessellation of different geometry patches are written
		into separate files.</li>
		<li>A 3D discretization geometry. These are 3D triangles.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The two first meshes are intermediate steps to reach the third one which is
	the exploitable mesh for computation. Intermediate meshes are kept because
	they can be used in specific algorithms.</p>
	<h2>XML file</h2>
	<p>The exact format is given by a <a href="https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jcae/trunk/amibe/src/org/jcae/mesh/xmldata/jcae.dtd">DTD</a> (XML Schema format coming ASAP). The information it contains are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Path to binary files</li>
		<li>Number of nodes and triangles</li>
		<li>Path to geometry (only required for some algorithm)</li>
		<li>Description of groups and pointer in the binary group files</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Binary files</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>To ensure portability, binary files of amibe are always written in big endian.</li>
		<li>To make files easy to parse, they contains only one type of data (64 bit integer or double).</li>
		<li>Binary files do not contain any headers or meta data, they are only raw array.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>1D binary files</h3>
	<p>An example of 1D XML file linking to these 1D binary files can be found <a href="amibe-samples/jcae1d">here</a>.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="amibe-samples/jcae1d.files/nodes1d.bin">jcae1d.files/nodes1d.bin</a></dt>
		<dd>1D node coordinates.
		All curves are concatenated, <code>offset</code> attribute tells at which
		position a curve is stored into binary file.
		File length is <code>(sum of all number of nodes)*8</code>.</dd>

		<dt><a href="amibe-samples/jcae1d.files/nodes1dref.bin">jcae1d.files/nodes1dref.bin</a></dt>
		<dd>References to geometrical vertices.  We need to glue edge endpoints together
		when they are referring to the same geometrical vertex.  An entry in this binary file
		consists of 2 integers:
		<ul>
			<li>Node index in <code>jcae1d.files/nodes1d.bin</code> (starting to 1).</li>
			<li>Geometrical vertex number.</li>
		</ul>
		All curves are concatenated, <code>offset</code> attribute tells at which
		position a curve is stored into binary file.
		In practice, edge endpoints are geometrical vertices, and there is no other candidate,
		file length is thus <code>2*(number of geometrical edges)*2*4</code>.</dd>

		<dt><a href="amibe-samples/jcae1d.files/beams1d.bin">jcae1d.files/beams1d.bin</a></dt>
		<dd>Beam tessellation.  This file contains node index in <code>jcae1d.files/nodes1d.bin</code>
		(starting to 1) of segment endpoints.
		All curves are concatenated, <code>offset</code> attribute tells at which
		position a curve is stored into binary file.
		File length is <code>(number of segments)*2*4</code>.</dd>
	</dl>
	<h3>2D binary files</h3>
	<p>An example of 2D XML file linking to these 2D binary files can be found <a href="amibe-samples/jcae2d.1">here</a>.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="amibe-samples/jcae2d.1.files/nodes2d.bin">jcae2d.<i>&lt;patch_number&gt;</i>.files/nodes2d.bin</a></dt>
		<dd>2D node coordinates.
		File length is <code>(number of nodes)*8*2</code>.</dd>

		<dt><a href="amibe-samples/jcae2d.1.files/nodes1dref.bin">jcae2d.<i>&lt;patch_number&gt;</i>.files/nodes1dref.bin</a></dt>
		<dd>References to 1D vertices.  This is needed to glue patch boundaries. 2D vertices on different
		patches are assigned the same reference number if and only if they shared the same 1D ancestor.
		By convention, inner nodes are first written into <code>jcae2d.<i>&lt;n&gt;</i>.files/nodes2d.bin</code>,
		then boundary nodes are appended.  This file contains an array of integers which are global reference
		numbers (and must be non-null).
		File length is <code>(number of reference nodes)*4</code>.</dd>

		<dt><a href="amibe-samples/jcae2d.1.files/triangles2d.bin">jcae2d.<i>&lt;patch_number&gt;</i>.files/triangles2d.bin</a></dt>
		<dd>Patch tessellation.  This file contains node index in <code>jcae2d.<i>&lt;n&gt;</i>.files/nodes2d.bin</code>
		(starting to 0) of triangles.
		File length is <code>(number of triangles)*3*4</code>.</dd>
	</dl>
	<h3>3D binary files</h3>
	<p>An example of 3D XML file linking to these 3D binary files can be found <a href="amibe-samples/jcae3d">here</a>.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt><a href="amibe-samples/jcae3d.files/nodes3d.bin">jcae3d.files/nodes3d.bin</a></dt>
		<dd>3D node coordinates.
		File length is <code>(number of nodes)*8*3</code>.</dd>

		<dt><a href="amibe-samples/jcae3d.files/nodes1dref.bin">jcae3d.files/nodes1dref.bin</a></dt>
		<dd>References to 1D vertices.  This may be needed if we want to preserve patch boundaries,
		this file has the same structure as in 2D.
		File length is <code>(number of reference nodes)*4</code>.</dd>

		<dt><a href="amibe-samples/jcae3d.files/triangles3d.bin">jcae3d.files/triangles3d.bin</a></dt>
		<dd>Geometry tessellation.
		File length is <code>(number of triangles)*3*4</code>.</dd>

		<dt><a href="amibe-samples/jcae3d.files/groups.bin">jcae3d.files/groups.bin</a></dt>
		<dd>Groups.
		Each group contains the list of index (starting to 0) of triangles enclosed in this group.
		All groups are concatenated, <code>offset</code> attribute tells at which
		index (this is not position, it has to be multiplicated by 4!) a group is stored into binary file.
		File length is <code>(total number of triangles)*4</code>.</dd>
	</dl>
	<h2>Examples</h2>
	<p>Here is how one can retrieve the 3D nodes coordinates of the 3rd triangle of the group named "foobar":</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Parse <a href="amibe-samples/jcae3d">3D XML root file</a> into a DOM.</li>
		<li>Search the foobar node in the XML structure either with DOM API or XPath.</li>
		<li>Get the foobar group offset in the binary group file</li>
		<li>Seek the binary group file to <code>offset+8</code> and get the triangle ID</li>
		<li>Seek the binary triangle file to <code>triangle ID</code></li>
		<li>Get the 3 nodes ID</li>
		<li>Seek the binary node file to the 3 nodes ID</li>
	</ul>
<p>A Java code to do it will look like this:</p>
<pre>
Document document = parseXML("jcae3d");

//Open binary files
RandomAccessFile rafNodes = new RandomAccessFile(getNodeFile(document), "r");
RandomAccessFile rafTriangles = new RandomAccessFile(getTriaFile(document), "r");
RandomAccessFile rafGroups = new RandomAccessFile(getGrpFile(document), "r");

//Search the foobar node in the XML structure	
Element fooBar = getGroup(document, "foobar");

//Get the foobar group offset
long index = getGroupOffset(fooBar);

//Seek the binary group file to 4*index+2*4 and get the triangle ID
rafGroups.seek(4*index+8L);
int triangleID = rafGroups.readInt();

//Seek the binary triangle file to triangle ID
rafTriangles.seek(triangleID*3*4);

//Get the 3 nodes ID
int [] nodeIDs = new int[3];
for(int i=0; i&lt;3; i++)
	nodeIDs[i] = rafTriangles.readInt();

for(int i=0; i&lt;3; i++)
{
	rafNodes.seek(nodeIDs[i]*3*8);
	double x = rafNodes.readDouble();
	double y = rafNodes.readDouble();
	double z = rafNodes.readDouble();
	System.out.println(x+" "+y+" "+z);
}
