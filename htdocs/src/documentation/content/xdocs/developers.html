	<h1>What jCAE developers should know</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>jCAE is an assembly of several components. To know where to start see the
	<a href="architecture.html">architecture</a> diagram.</p>

	<h2>Compiling occjava-swig</h2>
	<p>This is an <a
	href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/jni/">JNI</a> Opencascade
	wrapper generated with <a href="http://www.swig.org">Swig</a>. On Linux the
	native part is built with <a
	href="http://sourceware.org/autobook/">autotools</a> and g++. For Windows a <a
	href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/">Visual Studio
	2005</a> project is provided. In both cases the swig process (to generate .cxx
	from .i) is handled so you do not have to call swig manually. The swig
	process also generates .java files. They must be compiled using the provided
	<a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> script (<code>build.xml</code>) to
	create the <code>occjava.jar</code> file.</p>

	<p>On Windows you must tell Visual Studio where you installed dependencies. To
	do so go to Tools, Options, Project and Solutions, VC++ directories. You must add
	swig binary path, Opencascade include and library path, and Java include path.</p>
	<p>On Linux, configure script should find all dependencies (otherwise set CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS)
	but Opencascade. For Opencascade you have to set the CASROOT environment variable.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Adding new classes to occjava-swig is easy but if you want to add new typemaps
	you may have a look to gp.i for examples. Reading swig and JNI references may
	also be required.</p>
	<h2>Compiling jCAE-mesher and jcae-viewer3d</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Edit the build.properties file to set properties. You may also create the lib
	directory and make link to theses dependencies.</li>
	<li>Run <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a></li>
	<li>Check that jar file(s) have been created in the lib directory. At the
	end of the jCAE-mesher compilation you should get jcae.jar and
	jcae-mesherocc.jar in the lib directory. At the end of jcae-viewer3d
	compilation you shoud get a jcae-viewer3d.jar file in the lib
	directory.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Compiling Netbeans modules</h2>

	<p>TODO I want to kown what's going on with that: <a
	href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3806445">http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3806445</a></p>
	<p>The 2 Netbeans modules are grouped in a module suite named jcae-netbeans-suite, which must be loaded in
	netbeans.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>jcae-netbeans have dependencies on jCAE-mesher and jcae-viewer. To provide these dependencies you should read jcae-netbeans-suite/jcae-netbeans/INSTALL.</li>
	<li>occjava (the netbeans module) needs occjava-swig files (OccJava.dll, libOccJava.so, occjava.jar) in
	jcae-netbeans-suite/occjava/release/modules/ext/. Make links or copy them.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Reference: <a href="http://platform.netbeans.org/">http://platform.netbeans.org/</a></p>
	<h2>Concerning Ant</h2>
	<p><a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> is command line tool. If you do
	not like command line tool, you should know that Ant is a standard in Java
	world and that all IDE (including Netbeans and Eclipse) allow to import
	project from an Ant script.  In Netbeans this feature is called "Java
	Project with Existing Ant Script".</p>
