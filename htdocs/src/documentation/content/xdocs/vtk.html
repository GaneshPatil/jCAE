		<title> jCAE - VTK </title>
	</head>
	<body>
	<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The jCAE project has started a migration process from Java3D to VTK. The main reason why
we are giving up java3d is the lack of picking features. The <code>viewer3d</code> module will
be replaced by a <code>vtk-util</code> module.</p>
	<h1>Building VTK</h1>
	<h2>Getting source</h2>
<p>Kitware doesn't provide binary distributions with Java binding enabled so you have to build
VTK by yourself. The current version of vtk-util requires at least VTK 5.2, and is also known
to work with VTK 5.3 (current CVS HEAD). The latter is an unreleased CVS version.
See <a href="http://www.vtk.org">http://www.vtk.org</a>.</p>
	<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>Here are the requirements to build VTK with Java binding:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>patch</code>. You have it in your Linux distro. There are also <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/patch.htm">Windows binaries</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.cmake.org"/>cmake</a></li>
	<li>GNU make and gcc [Linux], or Visual Studio Express [Windows], or any other set of compilation tool supported by cmake.</li>
	<li>OpenGL header and developer libraries</li>
	<li>The Sun Java Development Kit</li>
</ul>
<p>On Debian/Ubuntu system just do:</p>
<pre>apt-get install patch make cmake libgl1-mesa-dev sun-java6-jdk</pre>
	<h2>Patching</h2>
<p>By developing jCAE we fixed several problems in VTK and sent our patches to VTK Bug Tracker. They
are not yet integrated in the VTK CVS repository. You may find them here:
<a href="https://jcae.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jcae/trunk/vtk-util/patch">
https://jcae.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jcae/trunk/vtk-util/patch</a>. The patching commands will look like this:</p>
<pre class="code">cd /a/foo/path/VTK
patch -p1 &lt; /tmp/depth
patch -p1 &lt; /tmp/displayList
patch -p1 &lt; /tmp/offset
patch -p1 &lt; /tmp/translucent
patch -p1 &lt; /tmp/underscore
patch -p1 &lt; /tmp/warning
patch -p1 &lt; /tmp/light
</pre>

<p>We are maintaining our patches with the help of <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt">quilt</a>;
the list of patches above may become outdated, but if you have <code>quilt</code> installed on
your machine, you can run the <code>apply.sh</code> shell script under <code>vtk-util/patch/nightly/</code>
or <code>vtk-util/patch/5.2/</code> like this:</p>
<pre class="code">cd /a/foo/path/VTK
sh /path/to/vtk-util/patch/nightly/apply.sh
</pre>

<p>This script calls <code>quilt</code> to apply patches listed in the <code>series</code> file. We maintain our own VTK tree this way, so this method should always work.</p>

	<h2>Configuring and building</h2>
<pre class="code">mkdir /a/bar/path/build-vtk
cd /a/bar/path/build-vtk
cmake /a/foo/path/VTK
</pre>
<p>This will create a default configuration file name <code>CMakeCache.txt</code>. To build the
Java binding you have to modify it. Here is an example for Debian like distribution:</p>
<pre class="code">
VTK_WRAP_JAVA:BOOL=ON
//Path to a program.
JAVA_ARCHIVE:FILEPATH=/usr/bin/jar

//Path to a file.
JAVA_AWT_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/include/

//Path to a library.
JAVA_AWT_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/lib/i386/libjawt.so

//Path to a program.
JAVA_COMPILE:FILEPATH=/usr/bin/javac

//Path to a file.
JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/include/

//Path to a file.
JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH2:PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/include/linux

//Path to a program.
JAVA_RUNTIME:FILEPATH=/usr/bin/java
</pre>
<p>To speed up compilation, you can disable Python and Tcl wrappers, and always use
system libraries (if headers and libraries are installed, of course) by setting all
<code>VTK_USE_SYSTEM_*</code> variables to <code>ON</code>.
Then rerun <code>cmake ../VTK</code> to take the change into account.
Finally run <code>make</code>.</p>
<p>The building process on Windows is similar except that the CMakeCache.txt edition
can be done through a GUI and that you will probably use Visual Studio instead
of GNU Make/GCC.</p>
