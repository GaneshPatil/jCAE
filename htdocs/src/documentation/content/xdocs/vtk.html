		<title> jCAE - VTK </title>
	</head>
	<body>
	<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The jCAE project has started a migration process from Java3D to VTK. The main reason why
we are giving up java3d is the lake of picking features. The <code>viewer3d</code> module will
be replaced by a <code>vtk-util</code> module.</p>
	<h1>Building VTK</h1>
	<h2>Getting source</h2>
<p>Kitware doesn't provide binary distributions with Java binding enabled so you have to build
VTK by yourself. The current version of vtk-util require at least VTK 5.1 and is known to work
with VTK 5.3 (current CVS HEAD). Both are unreleased CVS versions. See <a href="http://www.vtk.org">http://www.vtk.org</a>.</p>
	<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>Here are the requirements to build VTK with Java binding:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>patch</code>. You have it in your Linux distro. There are also <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/patch.htm">Windows binaries</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.cmake.org"/>cmake</a></li>
	<li>GNU make and gcc [Linux], or Visual Studio Express [Windows], or any other set of compilation tool supported by cmake.</li>
	<li>OpenGL header and developer libraries</li>
	<li>The Sun Java Development Kit</li>
</ul>
<p>On Debian/Ubuntu system just do:</p>
<pre>apt-get install patch make cmake libgl1-mesa-dev sun-java6-jdk</pre>
	<h2>Patching</h2>
<p>Developing jCAE we fixed several problems in VTK and made some patches. Writting thoses lines,
those patches are not yet integrated in the VTK CVS repository. You may find them here:
<a href="https://jcae.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jcae/trunk/vtk-util/patch">
https://jcae.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jcae/trunk/vtk-util/patch</a>. The patching commands will look like this:</p>
<pre class="code">cd VTK
patch -p0 &lt; /tmp/underscore.patch
patch -p0 &lt; /tmp/displayList.patch
patch -p0 &lt; /tmp/translucent.patch
patch -p0 &lt; /tmp/offset.patch
</pre>
	<h2>Configuring and building</h2>
<pre class="code">mkdir build-vtk
cd build-vtk
cmake ../VTK
</pre>
<p>This will create a default configuration file name <code>CMakeCache.txt</code>. To build the
Java binding you have to modify it. Here is an example for Debian like distribution:</p>
<pre class="code">
VTK_WRAP_JAVA:BOOL=ON
//Path to a program.
JAVA_ARCHIVE:FILEPATH=/usr/bin/jar

//Path to a file.
JAVA_AWT_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/include/

//Path to a library.
JAVA_AWT_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/lib/i386/libjawt.so

//Path to a program.
JAVA_COMPILE:FILEPATH=/usr/bin/javac

//Path to a file.
JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/include/

//Path to a file.
JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH2:PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/include/linux

//Path to a program.
JAVA_RUNTIME:FILEPATH=/usr/bin/java
</pre>
<p>Then rerun <code>cmake ../VTK</code> to take the change into account.
Finally run <code>make</code>.</p>
<p>The building process on Windows is similar except that the CMakeCache.txt edition
can be done through a GUI and that you will probably use Visual Studio instead
of GNU Make/GCC.</p>
