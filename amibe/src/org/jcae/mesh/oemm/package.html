 Memory Management and Simplification of Huge Meshes</a>
 a data structure for out-of-core processing of huge meshes (also called
 Octree based External Memory Mesh, or OEMM).  The <code>org.jcae.mesh.oemm</code>
 package is a Java implementation of these ideas.  Algorithms to build and
 use this data structure are detailed below.
</p>
<h2>Building an OEMM</h2>
<p>
 An OEMM structure is designed to handle very large meshes.
 We cannot work with indexed triangles because storing
 indices in memory would require lots of RAM.  For this reason, our
 starting point is a triangle soup, which consists of a sequence of
 triangles, each triangle being represented by the coordinates of
 its three vertices and predefined attributes.
 This triangle soup had been computed for instance by running
 {@link org.jcae.mesh.Mesher} and setting <code>org.jcae.mesh.Mesher.triangleSoup</code>
 property to <code>true</code>.
</p>
<h3 name="structure">Determination of the octree structure</h3>
<p>
 An empty {@link org.jcae.mesh.oemm.OEMM} is first created with a given
 maximul depth <code>dmax</code>, and its bounding box is set.  This is needed to transform
 double coordinates into integers (and also the other way around), see
 {@link org.jcae.mesh.oemm.OEMM#double2int} and
 {@link org.jcae.mesh.oemm.OEMM#int2double}.
</p>
<p>
 The triangle soup is read a first time by
 {@link org.jcae.mesh.oemm.RawStorage#countTriangles}; for each triangle,
 vertices are located in the smallest octant (i.e. with the depth
 specified when creating this octree), and a counter is
 incremented for all octants containing at least one vertex.  At the end
 of this first pass, we know how many triangles will be collected by each
 octant.
</p>
<p>
 An optimization is then performed by
 {@link org.jcae.mesh.oemm.Aggregate#compute} on this
 {@link org.jcae.mesh.oemm.OEMM} structure: octants are recursively
 merged with their siblings if
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The total number of triangles is less than a given threshold</li>
  <li>Neighbors in the final octree have a depth difference not
      greater than 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>
 The optimized octree has fewer leaves than the original, and the number
 of neighbors is bounded by a small constant.  This property is important
 so that loading a node and all its neighbors can be performed in constant
 time.  It is also important to understand that there will be trouble if
 an edge is so long that its vertices belong to non-adjacent leaves.
 At the moment, this situation is not detected, so <code>dmax</code> must
 be chosen high enough in order to avoid this problem.
</p>

<h3 name="dispatch">Dispatching triangles into octants</h3>
<p>
 Triangles can then be gathered by octants in
 {@link org.jcae.mesh.oemm.RawStorage#dispatch}.
 The previous step counted the number of triangles which will be assigned
 to each octant. so dispatched file offset for each octant can be computed,
 Triangles are read a second time from the triangle soup and copied into
 the right block.  This dispatched file is similar to the triangle soup,
 but triangles have been sorted by octant.
</p>

<h4>Indexing vertices and triangles</h4>
<p>
 In each octant, triangle soup is replaced by an indexed mesh, and
 connections to adjacent octants are kept.  This is performed by
 {@link org.jcae.mesh.oemm.RawStorage#indexOEMM} in two steps.
</p>

<h3>Indexing internal vertices</h3>
<p>
 The final data structure for each octant is composed of its interior
 vertices and a list of indexed triangles.  A preorder traversal of
 the octree is performed, and vertices are read from the dispatched
 file.  As triangles have been rearranged by octants, a global index
 can be assigned so that all indices of the first leaf are lower than
 those of the second leaf, etc.  Or in other words, each leaf has an
 index range which has been already computed, and global indices are
 equal to the sum of the minimal index
 {@link org.jcae.mesh.oemm.OEMMNode#minIndex} and a local index.
 The task performed during this traversal is thus to identify unique
 interior vertices.  This is done by using
 {@link org.jcae.mesh.oemm.PAVLTreeIntArrayDup} class, which is an
 implementation of AVL trees based on Ben Pfaff's
 <a href="http://adtinfo.org/">GNU libavl</a>.
</p>
<p>
 For each leaf, a list of neighbor leaves was computed during the
 <a href="structure">initial step</a>.
 The maximal depth difference between neighbor leaves is 2, so a leaf 
 has at most 6*16+12*4+8=152 neighbors, and information about neighbors
 for vertices can be packed in a byte array.
 If a triangle contains interior and outer vertices, outer ones are located
 inside those neighbor leaves, and the index within this list is associated
 with interior vertices.
</p>

<h3>Indexing external vertices</h3>
<p>
 The dispatched file is read another time to build a list of indexed triangles.
 For each octant, interior vertices for itself and all its neighbors are
 loaded into memory.  Triangles are then read again from the dispatched file,
 and vertices are replaced by their global index (or more precisely by its
 leaf and local indices).
