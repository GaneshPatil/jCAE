Mesh data structure.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
A mesh is composed of triangles, edges and vertices.  There are
many data structures to represent meshes, and we focused on the
following constraints:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Memory usage must be minimal in order to perform very large
      meshes.</li>
  <li>Mesh traversal must be cheap.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We decided to implement a triangle-based data structure which is known
to be more memory efficient.  A {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Triangle}
is composed of three {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Vertex}, three links
to adjacent triangles, and each vertex contains a backward link to one
of its incident triangles.  It is then possible to loop within triangles
or around vertices.
</p>

<p>
But there is also a need for lighter data structures.  For instance,
visualization does not need adjacency relations, we only need to
store triangles.
</p>
 
<p>
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Mesh} constructor takes an optional
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.traits.MeshTraitsBuilder}
argument to fully describe the desired mesh data structure.  Once a
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Mesh} instance is created, its features
cannot be modified.  With this argument, it is possible to specify if
adjacent relations between triangles have to be computed, if an octree
is needed to locate vertices, if triangles and/or nodes are stored in
a list or a set, etc.  Example:
</p>
<pre>
   MeshTraitsBuilder mtb = new MeshTraitsBuilder();
   // Store triangles into a set
   mtb.addTriangleSet();
   TriangleTraitsBuilder ttb = new TriangleTraitsBuilder();
   // Store adjacency relations with HalfEdge
   ttb.addHalfEdge();
   mtb.add(ttb);
   // Create a new instance with these features
   Mesh mesh = new Mesh(mtb);
   // Then each triangle created by mesh.createTriangle
   // will contain objects needed to store adjacency relations.
   Triangle t = (Triangle) mesh.createTriangle(...);
   // Vertices must be created by mesh.createVertex
   Vertex v = (Vertex) mesh.createVertex(...);
</pre>
  
<p>
When a {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Mesh} instance is created without
specifying a {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.traits.MeshTraitsBuilder}
instance, {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.traits.MeshTraitsBuilder#getDefault3D}
is implicitly used.
</p>

<h2>Adjacency relations</h2>

<p>
When adjacency relations are not requested by
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.traits.MeshTraitsBuilder},
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Mesh#createTriangle} creates
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.AbstractTriangle} instances
which only contains vertices and no other data.
</p>

<p>
Adjacency relations can be requested either with
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.traits.TriangleTraitsBuilder#addHalfEdge} or
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.traits.TriangleTraitsBuilder#addShallowHalfEdge}.
With the former, {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Mesh#createTriangle} creates
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.TriangleHE} instances and with the latter,
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Mesh#createTriangle} creates
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.TriangleVH} instances.  Both classes inherits
from {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Triangle} superclass, and in this class
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Triangle#adj} member is an
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.AdjacencyWrapper} interface which is
extended by inner classes.
</p>

<h3>With {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.TriangleHE.AdjacencyHE}</h3>
<p>
An
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.TriangleHE.AdjacencyHE} instance contains a private
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.HalfEdge} instance, which represents an
edge of underlying triangle.  This edge is linked to the next edge
in the same triangle; in fact
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Mesh#createTriangle} creates three edges
which are linked together to form a cycle, so a single reference is
needed to access these three edges.
</p>

<h3>With {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.TriangleVH.AdjacencyVH}</h3>
<p>
This is a more compact implementation of adjacency relations: edges are
not created as distinct objects, but taken as a local number (with
values 0, 1 or 2) of a triangle.
</p>

<p>
An
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.TriangleVH.AdjacencyVH} instance contains three
links to adjacent {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.TriangleVH} instances,
and {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.TriangleVH.AdjacencyVH#adjPos} member is a
packed representation of local numbers in adjacent triangles.
In order to handle non-manifold meshes,
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.TriangleVH.AdjacencyVH#adj} member is an array of
<code>Object</code> instances instead of
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.TriangleVH} instances.
</p>

<p>
The downside is that edges are not physical objects but can be accessed
only through handles.  For instance, if edges have to be sorted in order
to be processed in a certain order (as in
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.algos3d.DecimateHalfEdge}),
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.TriangleHE.AdjacencyHE} must be used instead of
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.TriangleVH.AdjacencyVH}. 
</p>

<h2>Mesh traversal</h2>

<p>
For {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.TriangleVH} instances,
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.VirtualHalfEdge} are handles on edges.
Both {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.VirtualHalfEdge} and
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.HalfEdge} inherits from
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.AbstractHalfEdge}, thus algorithms
can be written without code duplication for both
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.TriangleHE} and
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.TriangleVH} instances if they only
refer to {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.AbstractHalfEdge} and not
their derived classes.

<p>
When designing these classes two main goals were taken into account:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>To compute very large meshes (containing several million faces).</li>
  <li>To allow distributed meshing.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Some classes do not exist (like <code>MMesh2D</code>) because processing can be
performed more efficiently without these classes.
</p>

<p>
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.MMesh0D} is a set of <code>TopoDS_Vertex</code>,
it contains all the geometrical vertices of the geometry.  Uniqueness of 3D
nodes is guaranteed at this stage, a surjective map is defined between
topological vertices and geometrical vertices.
</p>

<p>
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.MMesh1D} is a 1D discretization of the whole
geometry.  It is implemented via a map which binds <code>TopoDS_Edge</code>
instances to {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.SubMesh1D}.
</p>

<p>
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.SubMesh1D} is a 1D discretization of a given
topological edge, and end points are taken into a {@link
org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.MMesh0D} instance to guarantee node uniqueness.
Typically 1D discretization is very fast, but as shared points belong to
a unique {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.MMesh0D} instance, this step
can be distributed if it is worth.
This class contains a set of {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.MNode1D} and
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.MEdge1D} instances.
</p>

<p>
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Mesh} is a 3D discretization of the whole
geometry.  This is by far the largest structure, so all elements which were
not absolutely necessary have been removed, and it now mostly contains a
set of {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Triangle} instances and a set of
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Vertex} instances.  Edges are not stored
to save space.
3D elements are built by projecting {@link
org.jcae.mesh.amibe.patch.Mesh2D} instances into 3D space.  Nodes
coordinates are computed from their 2D coordinates, triangle topology is
preserved, and nodes uniqueness on boundaries is guaranteed because all
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.patch.Mesh2D} instances are bound to the same
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.MMesh1D} instance.
</p>

<p>
Since most of the time is spent meshing 2D surfaces, great care must be
taken of {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.patch.Mesh2D} class.  Topological
faces are meshed independently, so there is no memory requirements here,
and everything needed to speed up processing is kept.  This class currently
contains a set of {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Triangle} instances and
a {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.util.KdTree} data structure with
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.patch.Vertex2D} instances.
