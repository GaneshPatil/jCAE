Algorithms for 1D meshing.

<p>
These classes implement algorithms for 1D meshing.  They have all a
roughly similar layout, but it has not been finalized yet, which is
why there is no well-defined interface.
</p>

<p>
All algorithms apply on {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.MMesh1D} instances,
so this instance is passed as an argument of constructors.  When algorithms
may accept optional parameters, a <code>setParameters</code> method is
available.  Meshing is performed by calling the <code>compute()</code> method.
