Algorithms for 2D meshing.

<p>
These classes implement algorithms for 2D meshing.  They have all a
roughly similar layout, but it has not been finalized yet, which is
why there is no well-defined interface.
</p>

<p>
All algorithms apply on {@link org.jcae.mesh.mesher.ds.SubMesh2D} instances,
so this instance is passed as an argument of constructors.  Some algorithms
may also accept optional arguments, but a better option would be to have
another method for changing default parameters.  Meshing is performed by
calling the <code>compute()</code> method.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes algorithms may be called from other algos (like
{@link org.jcae.mesh.mesher.algos2d.CutEdges} and
{@link org.jcae.mesh.mesher.algos2d.CollapseEdges} which are invoked by
{@link org.jcae.mesh.mesher.algos2d.TargetSize}).  For convenience,
a <code>computeFace(org.jcae.mesh.mesher.ds.SubMesh2D submesh2d)</code>
static method is then defined.
