Data structures for meshing.

<p>
These classes are the data structures used when meshing a topological shape.
They can be combined into three groups:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>{@link org.jcae.mesh.mesher.ds.MNode1D},
      {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Vertex},
      {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.MNode3D},
      {@link org.jcae.mesh.mesher.ds.MEdge1D},
      {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Triangle} and
      {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.MFace3D}.</dt>
    <dd>Mesh entities.</dd>
  <dt>{@link org.jcae.mesh.mesher.ds.SubMesh1D} and
      {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Mesh}.</dt>
    <dd>Portions of meshes associated with a given topological element
      (edges in 1D, surfaces in 2D).</dd>
  <dt>{@link org.jcae.mesh.mesher.ds.MMesh0D},
      {@link org.jcae.mesh.mesher.ds.MMesh1D} and
      {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.MMesh3D}.</dt>
    <dd>Meshes of the whole geometry.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
When designing these classes two main goals were taken into account:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>To compute very large meshes (containing several million faces).</li>
  <li>To allow distributed meshing.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Some classes do not exist (like <code>MMesh2D</code>) because processing can be
performed more efficiently without these classes.
</p>

<p>
{@link org.jcae.mesh.mesher.ds.MMesh0D} is a set of <code>TopoDS_Vertex</code>,
it contains all the geometrical vertices of the geometry.  Uniqueness of 3D
nodes is guaranteed at this stage, a surjective map is defined between
topological vertices and geometrical vertices.
</p>

<p>
{@link org.jcae.mesh.mesher.ds.MMesh1D} is a 1D discretization of the whole
geometry.  It is implemented via a map which binds <code>TopoDS_Edge</code>
instances to {@link org.jcae.mesh.mesher.ds.SubMesh1D}.
</p>

<p>
{@link org.jcae.mesh.mesher.ds.SubMesh1D} is a 1D discretization of a given
topological edge, and end points are taken into a {@link
org.jcae.mesh.mesher.ds.MMesh0D} instance to guarantee node uniqueness.
Typically 1D discretization is very fast, but as shared points belong to
a unique {@link org.jcae.mesh.mesher.ds.MMesh0D} instance, this step
can be distributed if it is worth.
This class contains a set of {@link org.jcae.mesh.mesher.ds.MNode1D} and
{@link org.jcae.mesh.mesher.ds.MEdge1D} instances.
</p>

<p>
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.MMesh3D} is a 3D discretization of the whole
geometry.  This is by far the largest structure, so all elements which were
not absolutely necessary have been removed, and it now mostly contains a
set of {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.MFace3D} instances and a set of
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.MNode3D} instances.  Edges are not stored
to save space.
3D elements are built by projecting {@link
org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Mesh} instances into 3D space.  Nodes
coordinates are computed from their 2D coordinates, triangle topology is
preserved, and nodes uniqueness on boundaries is guaranteed because all
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Mesh} instances are bound to the same
{@link org.jcae.mesh.mesher.ds.MMesh1D} instance.
</p>

<p>
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.MNode3D} and 
{@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.MFace3D} classes are very simple, the former
carry out 3D coordinates and the latter is defined by its three vertices.
</p>

<p>
Since most of the time is spent meshing 2D surfaces, great care must be
taken of {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Mesh} class.  Topological
faces are meshed independently, so there is no memory requirements here,
and everything needed to speed up processing is kept.  This class currently
contains a set of {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Vertex} instances and a set
of {@link org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Triangle} instances.
